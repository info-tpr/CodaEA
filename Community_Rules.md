# Community Rules

CodaEA is a simple yet sophisticated environment, designed to reward active members with both prestige (by the accumulation of Reputation points and assignment of Badges), and financial incentive.  Coming soon, Reputation will be rewarded directly with CODA Tokens cryptocurrency, and a liquidity pool will allow you to cash the tokens out for other currencies.

In order to promote loyalty and a sense of community value, we established a system of rewards that works as follows.

Also, please note that the content built up in CodaEA is a combination of language from software developers and users, and not from CodaEA or its employees.  As such, we are not responsible for that content, whether it may violate personal feelings or laws of any kind.  We will not be held responsible for that, and will make best effort to make any corrections that are brought to our attention.  But we will not monitor the data for any violations - it is up to the Community to self-manage, and bring it to our attention when they can't.

## Etiquette

It is important to foster a professional environment that supports what everyone is trying to do - operate their software and solve problems with it.  When you post, please make sure your post adheres to the following guidelines.  If it doesn't, it will be removed by moderators, and possibly you will lose Reputation points for that.

Remember, excessive abuse of these rules can result in the suspension or cancellation of your Account.

### Error Analysis

Error Analysis pertains to analyzing the error, and determining how important the error is (severity), and what it means in plain English.  In order to perform Error Analysis, you must have been assigned either the Developer or Developer Administrator for that network, or have earned the Error Editor for that network.

It is our hope that the criteria of having earned the badges through reputation or manual vetting will have given that power to people who won't abuse that.  Please be sure to follow these guidelines when posting:

- If there is some disagreement as to the Severity level, please discuss and work it out.  If you cannot, then set it to the "higher" severity (the lower number).
- Please keep any language on the Accepted Meaning to professional description of the problem.  Don't post either personal or organizational blame, and keep comments or sayings out of it.  For example, don't say "because it's Apple and they only support their own hardware..."
- If there is some disagreement on the Accepted Meaning, or you wish to edit someone else's definition, please keep it impersonal and professional.  While people can get passionate about their knowledge and their jobs, what the community really needs is actual solutions.
- Don't put questions in Accepted Meaning.  Those should be reserved for Discussion Entries, or Troubleshooting Comments.
- Don't fill out the Accepted Meaning unless you believe your answer is authoritative.

### Discussion Entries

A Discussion is either a posing of a question, suggestion for cause or meaning, or some other pertinent item related to the software and the error message.

- Refrain from name-calling or blaming specific individuals or companies.  For example, don't blame Microsoft as a bad company, for an issue with some software.
- Don't use any swear words, or socially inappropriate terminology.
- Add links to your post if they provide helpful information for your suggestion or inquiry.
- Don't use any abusive language, especially towards other CodaEA Members!

### Troubleshooting Steps & Comments

A Troubleshooting Step is an attempt at suggesting a possible solution to the problem indicated by the error message.  This does not mean that the solution will work for everyone, in all situations.  Also, please be aware that following these steps will be taken at your own risk.  It is assumed that, as an Operator, you have sufficient abilities and experience to take backups, restore backups, and otherwise mitigate any risks involved in attempting the steps indicated.  By using this system, you accept the risks of any damage to your system or data, and you cannot blame neither the other member who suggested the steps, nor CodaEA or The Parallel Revolution for any damages arising from your use of the steps.

When you are posting or moderating these items, please use the following guidelines:

- Refrain from name-calling or blaming specific individuals or companies.  For example, don't blame Microsoft as a bad company, for an issue with some software.
- Don't use any swear words, or socially inappropriate terminology.
- Add links to your post if they provide helpful information for your suggestion or inquiry.
- Don't use any abusive language, especially towards other CodaEA Members!
- Add links to your post if they provide helpful information for your solution.
- Don't post questions in Troubleshooting Steps.  You can pose questions to the Troubleshooting post in Comments, or in the Error Discussion thread.

### Violations of Community Rules

Anyone can report that an item violates the rules.  To do so, vote "Report" on that item.  It will be flagged for Moderators to review.  A Moderator would then decide whether that item is indeed in violation or not.

If the item is found to be in violation, that item is removed from viewing.  Note that it is kept on record, but not visible to the public.  If, as the poster, you feel that the Moderator ruled incorrectly, you can appeal the ruling (your banned item is still visible to you, simply vote "Appeal" on it), in which case a different Moderator will be required to rule on it.  Rulings of a second Moderator are final.

If a user exceeds the threshold of confirmed violations in a given calendar year (currently 10), the account is disabled and the email address used is added to the banned list.  You can appeal to The Parallel Revolution by email, but depending on the severity of the violation you might not be granted access again.

If the item is found to not be in violation, no further penalty is incurred.

## Reputation

- Every time you post (an Error Discussion entry, Troubleshooting Step, or Comments), you are rewarded with 10 points.
- Every time you vote on someone's entry, you are awarded 10 points.  If you vote it up, the other person is awarded 10 points; if you vote it down, they are docked 10 points. Only vote down something that is really unhelpful, unclear, or abusive.  Awards are only granted once per item - you can't get rewarded multiple times on the same Discussion or Troubleshooting or Comment entry.
- Other activities may also result in awarding Reputation Points - see below.
- If your analysis finds a new error code for that network or app, you will be awarded reputation points.  You will also receive the Error Finder badge the first time you do so, which is also worth more points.
- Each badge you are awarded is worth 100 points.

## Badges

Badges are assigned either through earning them, or by Coda System Administrators.  If there are earning criteria, they are assigned by the CodaEA system as you meet the criteria.  For badges assigned by Coda System Administrators, contact [The Parallel Revolution](mailto:info@theparallelrevolution.com) ([website](https://www.theparallelrevolution.com)) to discuss your requirements and reasons.  All inquiries will be processed in US Eastern time during normal business hours.

Badges are also assigned in a Network (or app) context.  You could earn a badge for a specific network, but if you want to use the privileges on objects pertaining to another network, you need to earn that badge interacting with that network's objects (discussions, troubleshooting, comments & errors).  We created this segregation in order to build trust and prevent abuse of earned privileges.  It would not be appropriate, for example, if an expert in Cardano network operation were to try to moderate errors pertaining to Prometheus Node Exporter, unless they were also certified an expert in that domain as well.

The assignment of a Badge by the system also awards you 100 Reputation Points.

And, coming by the end of the year, for each of the badges you have earned, you will receive an NFT deposited into the payment wallet on record.
