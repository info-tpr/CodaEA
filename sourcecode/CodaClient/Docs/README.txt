To get your CodaClient working, you must have DotNet 6.0 installed on your environment.

Follow these instructions, or for Ubuntu you can use the included shell script to install .NET.

Windows: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net60
MacOS: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/macos
Linux: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux


CodaClient is both an application log analyzer, and an interface to participate in the CodaEA
Communities.  You will need a configuration file for each Application (or Network) that you are
participating in.  It allows you to:
- View and manage your Account and Settings
- View and manage sub-Accounts for your Organization
- View and participate in Discussions and Troubleshooting Steps for Error Codes occurring in a Network
- Report posts that violate community standards
- Moderate discussions (if you have earned Moderator status)

NOTE:  If you are an Application Software Developer, you will need a Developer account to be able
to establish authoritative Developer feedback on error messages, and access statistics captured
by CodaEA as to how many of what kinds of errors occur on which versions of your software.

These statistics are accessible only via the CodaEA API.

The full CodaEA API is documented at https://test.codaea.io
