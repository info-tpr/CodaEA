#What is CodaEA?

Coda means a concluding or closing part of a statement, or closing part of a musical piece.  CodaEA completes the job of application 
server operation by providing a much-needed service and functionality that will help both server operators, and software developers, 
to run and improve their server software.

CodaEA is an Error Analysis ecosystem designed to link communities around networks or applications for mutual support.  
Network Operators typically have the job of running server software, which emit execution logs.  Often, the error messages 
are cryptic or otherwise difficult to determine a) whether they are siginificant or not, and b) what you should do to fix it - 
especially if you are new to operating that software.

CodaEA is the solution.  It provides a public REST API to report the errors, and query to determine what the community has
analyzed as the appropriate meaning and severity of the error.  It facilitates discussion and troubleshooting.

Community Members earn reputation for their participation, and that reputation will be tied to the CODA Token cryptocurrency, which
are awarded to the Members' Cardano wallet by the end of every epoch.

CODA Tokens can also be offered as bounties to help incentivize and prioritize focus on the solution of specific error messages.

The CODA Token payouts and features will be coming later this year.

In order to be able to access the Coda database, you must create and validate an Operator Account.  To do this, please navigate

There are 3 types of Accounts:  Operator, Organizational Administrator, and Organizational User.  CodaClient is designed for
use by an Operator Account.
